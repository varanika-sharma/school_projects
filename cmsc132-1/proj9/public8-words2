Ah, my dear Watson, said he, striding into the room, I am very delighted to
see you! I trust that Mrs. Watson has entirely recovered from all the little
excitements connected with our adventure of the Sign of Four.

Thank you, we are both very well, said I, shaking him warmly by the
hand.

And I hope, also, he continued, sitting down in the rocking chair, that the
cares of medical practice have not entirely obliterated the interest which
you used to take in our little deductive problems.

On the contrary, I answered, it was only last night that I was looking over
my old notes, and classifying some of our past results.

I trust that you don't consider your collection closed.

Not at all. I should wish nothing better than to have some more of such
experiences.

Today, for example?

Yes, today, if you like.

And as far off as Birmingham?
