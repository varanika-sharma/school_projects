I glanced down at the new patent leathers which I was wearing. How on
earth- I began, but Holmes answered my question before it was asked.

Your slippers are new, he said. You could not have had them more than a few
weeks. The soles which you are at this moment presenting to me are slightly
scorched. For a moment I thought they might have got wet and been burned in
the drying. But near the instep there is a small circular wafer of paper
with the shopman's hieroglyphics upon it. Damp would of course have removed
this. You had, then, been sitting with our feet outstretched to the fire,
which a man would hardly do even in so wet a June as this if he were in his
full health.

Like all Holmes's reasoning the thing seemed simplicity itself when it was
once explained. He read the thought upon my features, and his smile had a
tinge of bitterness.

I am afraid that I rather give myself away when I explain, said he.  Results
without causes are much more impressive. You are ready to come to
Birmingham, then?

Certainly. What is the case?

You shall hear it all in the train. My client is outside in a
four wheeler. Can you come at once?

In an instant. I scribbled a note to my neighbor, rushed upstairs to explain
the matter to my wife, and joined Holmes upon the doorstep.

Your neighbor is a doctor, said he, nodding at the brass plate.

Yes; he bought a practice as I did.

An old established one?

Just the same as mine. Both have been ever since the houses were built.

Ah! Then you got hold of the best of the two.

I think I did. But how do you know?

By the steps, my boy. Yours are worn three inches deeper than his.  But this
gentleman in the cab is my client, Mr. Hall Pycroft. Allow me to introduce
you to him. Whip your horse up, cabby, for we have only just time to catch
our train.
